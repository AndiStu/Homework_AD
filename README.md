# Homework_AD
    This project contains a C implementation of an algorithm to distribute books into three partitions.

## Files

- `main.c`: The main C source file with the distribution algorithm.
- `book-distribution.cbp`: The Code::Blocks project file (for Code::Blocks users).
- `README.md`: This file with project information and instructions.

## Prerequisites

Before you can build and run this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- A C compiler (GCC recommended)
- Code::Blocks IDE (optional, if you prefer using it)
- Any other C-compatible IDE (Visual Studio, Eclipse, CLion, etc.)

## Building and Running

### Using GCC

1. **Open your terminal** and navigate to the project directory:
   cd /path/to/book-distributio
   Compile the code using GCC:
2. Compile the code using GCC:
   ```sh
   gcc main.c -o book-distribution
Run the executable:


./book-distribution:  ```


If you want to chage the count of pages in the books and/or the number of books, it can be done right at the beggining of the main function by changing the vector books[]
